# Flight-Price-Prediction

## Overview

- To learn and apply the concepts covered in our Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning Course, I applied various Machine Learning Models on the Dataset provided to Predict the price of a Flight based on given information.
- The Dataset was Preprocessed and Revelant Features such as Airline Name, Day of Journey, Duration of Journey, Location of Arrival and Departure, Time of Departure and Arrival and Total Stops were used for Prediction of the Price of Flight.
- Revelant Feature Engineering was used on the Features to Process. After training Models, the Best model was integrated with the Web Development and Website was deployed for usage of People.




## Bulit Using

- [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Learn: ML Libraries Used
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): ML Libraries Used
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): ML Libraries Used
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For Dataset Engineering
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): For optimised Function
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For Visualisations
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For Plots and Visualisations


## Pipeline

This is the main file with all the preprocessing, EDA, various Machine learning and Deep Learning Models.
- Importing all the revelant Libraries
- Importing the Dataset - [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHNt5vPyCyKRQIitvGmf48AI2tna5xSk)
- Data Visualisation
- PreProcessing and Feature Engineering 
- Splitting the DataSet into Train and Test to evaluate the performance of various Models.   
- Following Models were Implemented:
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Linear Regressor
  - XGB Regressor
  - LGBM Regressor
  - SVR
  - Deep Neural Network
- Then using tensorflow, we exported the model. In this case, we exported DNN.
